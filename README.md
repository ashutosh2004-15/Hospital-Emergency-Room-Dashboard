## 📊 Using the Dashboard

- You can open `Dashboard.xlsx` directly and explore the interactive dashboard.
- The workbook already contains the cleaned data snapshot (through Pivot Tables), so you don’t need the raw dataset just to view it.
- If you want to **refresh or reproduce the cleaning steps**:
  1. Download the full dataset (Hospital Emergency Room Data).
  2. update the Power Query source path (or parameter) inside Excel.
  3. Then click **Data → Refresh All** to reload with the full data.
